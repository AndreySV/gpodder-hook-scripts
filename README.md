# Summary

This repository contains gPodder hook scripts which I use for myself. Please feel free to fork or use this repository for your own purpose.

## gPodder hooks infrastructure (recommended way)

### What are hooks in gPodder?

Hooks are python scripts in ~/.config/gpodder/hooks. Each script must define a class named "gPodderHooks", otherwise it will be ignored.

### How to configure

You could copy or link the scripts in this repository to ~/.config/gpodder/hooks/ and everything should work fine.


# Hooks list

## tfh_shownotes_hook

"Tin Foil Hat Show" is a podcast produced by CafeNinja.

There is one special thing in this show. The show notes are hide in the FRONT_COVER image which is included in the mp3 file. This is the only place where you can find the show notes. So you have to run a few commands until you are able to read the notes.

This is the reason why I created some hooks to get this show notes automatically after I downloaded an episode with gPodder (http://gpodder.org/)

This github repository includes two options to configure your gPodder installation with this feature.
